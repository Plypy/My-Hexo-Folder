It's the 5th week, the last week before the middle term evaluation.

Oh... I'm exhausted, just having recorded my midterm presentations. It costed me about 1 wholed day to make the ppt, and 4 hours to record the video... Well my English is bad, so I have to retake it again and again. Even though the outcome isn't very well, because after long time of working and speaking, I made my voice hoarse, my mind stupid...

You can see my presentaion [here](https://talk.openmrs.org/t/gsoc-2014-openmrs-id-platform-improvements-midterm-presentation/321).

Anyway let's sum up this week.

### What I Have Done

1.  Completed the integration work with signup module and new data model.
1.  Integrated the new data model with the auth module.
2.  Built new model for verification.
3.  Used the new model to reimplement the email-verification work.
4.  Made a middle term presentaion, see above.

### What I Will Do

1.  Complete the integration work for reset-pwd and profile module.
2.  Figure out how to migrate data.
3.  Fix some issues maybe.

That's it, I need to sleep.
