It's about the midterm evaluation. Things have been proceeding fine thus far. Like last year I've made a report and published [here](https://talk.openmrs.org/t/gsoc-2015-openmrs-id-v2-1-platform-improvements-midterm-presentation/2261/7). It's been kind of taxing to record it as my English isn't very good and I haven't fully recovered from pharyngitis. And sadly few days later, it got severer again... :/

Besides the report, I've also mainly delivered:

+ bug fixes for ID-89
+ more work about ID-88
