According to the timeline on melange, GSoC of this year is approaching the end. Actually, tommorrow 17th Aug. is the suggested 'pencil down' date. The GSoC experience is really great and having two in a row is indeed something that will rooted in my memory.

Like last year I worked on the Dashboard this year, it's mainly about updating things and fixing bugs. However unlike last year's rookie works, it's more about efficiency and whole-structure change. Those modules left last year all have gotten updated.


I'm really not good at the words, so I think this is it. Coding in OpenMRS, "Write code, save lives"!
