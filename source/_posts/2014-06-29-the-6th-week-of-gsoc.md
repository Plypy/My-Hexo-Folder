Time to summarize again.

Well, I havn't done many things this week... Because it's the last week of this semester as well. I've been preparing my last final, and celebrating with my classmates after it.

Anyway, here is the usual list.

### What I Have Done
1.  Basically finished all the integration work.
2.  Created a prototype of the new `/profile` page. And here is the mockup.

3.  Fixed few trivial bugs.

### What I Will Do
1.  Make up all the validation work.
2.  Start to work on `ldapjs`.

That's it.
