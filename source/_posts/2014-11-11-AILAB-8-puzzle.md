For the sake of GUI requested by stupid AI teacher, and inspired by Winner Xia. I've built a simple 8 Puzzle game revised from [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).

Being a Muggle of front-end world, I've just made some slight changes.

**To Be Updated**
It's late...

**Update**
After some thoughts about what to write... I found that there is little to update... Anyway, this is the front-end that displays my A* algorithm, and since github pages could only server static webpages, I havn't added my back-end part. If you'd like to play it, go [here](https://github.com/Plypy/8puzzle/tree/node-server);
