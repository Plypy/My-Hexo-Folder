The biggest news for this week is that I've had my last final of this semster finished.

Well... Not many works I've done due to dealing with those finals. However, as the good news suggests, I'll have more time from now on to work on. Things will be better. The tough issue [ID-103](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/ID-103) is still ahead of me.

### Done 
+ After lots of discussion... I've fixed this [LDAP issue](https://talk.openmrs.org/t/lots-of-ldap-errors-with-email-verification-process-in-past-few-days/1951) reported by Michael. Something related with LDAP was wrong, but I don't know where it is. However, I'm pretty sure, it shouldn't be Dashboard's fault form the log file.

+ Discussed other issues and future works

## ToDo
+ ID-88, Replace MySQL legacy stuff.
