Another week of exam...

I've mainly done two things this week, finishing ID-89 and ID-102.

There is not much to talk about ID-102, just deleting and replacing... For ID-89, refactoring `ldap.js`, It's been a long time that I noticed that operations related with `ldap.js` would be much slower than the ordinary. After checking the search operations, I found that the old one will use search which has `baseDN` of `ou=users,dc=openmrs,dc=org` and a filter of `uid=USERNAME`. Then inspired by intuition, I realized that LDAP server may highly possible first fetch all entries under `baseDN` and then use that filter to select the items. This would be intolerant in production, as we can directly find the entry via `DN` of `uid=USERNAME,ou=users,dc=openmrs,dc=org`.

After performing a little experimentation on my machine and proving that search with direct `DN` would be 1 times more faster than with `filter`. I rewrote all the operations in the new ldap.js. Hence, this time, the refactor doesn't only focus on logic flow and readabilities, but also efficiency.

##TODO for Next Week
+ ES6 investigation
+ Something else interesting
