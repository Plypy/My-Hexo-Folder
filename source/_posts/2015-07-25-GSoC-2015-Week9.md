The restructuring work continues, this weeks I've mainly done some ending works of this, including:

+ Refactoring modules related with `email-verification`. Email templates now share a common layout, `actionId` and `verifyId` are replaced by a single `uuid`, few variable names are updated and some packages as well.

+ Reorganizing admin page related things, rearrage the middlewares so other user-modules won't bother privilege problems which makes things neat.
+ Updated modules to coform to new Dashboard.
+ More...

While I was doing the EJS 2 JADE works, I once again encountered a problem. Elliott had written this code below,
```
<script type="text/javascript">
$(function() {
    var paramRow = function(){
        return '<tr><% for (var j = 0; j < columns.length; j++) { %><td>'
            +'<input type="text" class="<%=columns[j].type%>" placeholder="<%=columns[j].value%>" name="'+($('#params tbody tr').length-1)+'-<%=columns[j].name%>"></td><% } %></tr>';
        };      
/// more
};
</script>
```

Basically it utilizes some code to generate the Javascript code that will be used in our pages, this section of Javascript would be a plain text block in JADE syntax. However, I can't figure out how to iterate within a plain text block, which seems not to be a good idea. 

Having tried lots of ways and considered the concept of static compiling, my solution are,
```
  -
    //- if only I could use jade.render in templates
    var rowAdded = '<tr>';
    for (var j = 0; j < settings.columns.length; ++j) {
      var col = settings.columns[j];
      rowAdded += '<td>';
      rowAdded += '<input type="text" class="'+ col.type + '" ' +
        'placeholder="' + col.value + '" ' +
        'name="{{index}}-' + col.name + '">';
      rowAdded += '</td>';
    }
    rowAdded += '</tr>';
  //- script start
  script(type='text/javascript').
    $(function() {
      var paramRow = function(){
        var index = $('#params tr').length-1;
        //- unescaped
        return  '!{rowAdded}'.replace(/{{index}}/g, index);
      };
    };
    /// more
```

This is quiet ugly... but it's the best solution I could get.
