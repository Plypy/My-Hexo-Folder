GSoC 2015 is about to the end. I've been working mainly on things that fix small issues now.

This week I managed to add Travis-CI support, which is commonly used free Continuous Integration services platform, to our project. It will provide you a VM for testing, where you need to provide scripts, .travis.yml, to set up the envrionment. For Dashboard, I need to get the OpenLDAP stuff and Mongo installed. This is where things are getting a little tricky as OpenLDAP installation requires some interactions. Luckily enough, I found out that I can set envrionment variable `DEBIANFRONTEND=noninteractive` to disable shell interactions, as we can configure it via configuration files later anyway.

My travis works are placed in this [repo](https://github.com/Plypy/openmrs-id-travis-test) specifically created for testing.
