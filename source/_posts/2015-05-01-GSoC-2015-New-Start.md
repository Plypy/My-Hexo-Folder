Well, I've been luckily enough to get selected in this year's GSoC with OpenMRS again. 

I'll continue to work on the Dashboard, to make it a better and mature platform, as the works I did last year was a rookie's first trial. Though it has been running well for quiet a long time, there are appreicably problems remained, as mentioned [here](https://talk.openmrs.org/t/some-id-dashboard-improvement-ideas/1296)

I hope I'll solve those problems during this summer, and present a better ID Dashboard.
