## The exciting GSoC work time is coming soon!!!

But still, there is 5 contests and waiting for me...Hope everything will be fine.


## About GSoC Works

### What I Have Done
+ Implemented a Multipass SSO for OpenMRS HelpDesk.
+ Chatted with Elliott about the future plan. I've got a clearer image about my walk, and made a initial rough work schedule.
+ Got more familiar with OpenMRS-ID


### What I Will Do

+ Currently, I'm working on OpenID-Connect, in order to build a OpenID server for OpenMRS-ID.
+ According to my proposal, I'll only do the refactor works in first few weeks.
+ Continue learn things about the DB, and make some testing prototype try.


This year's summer will be a great and fun one.
